//! # Memory States System
//!
//! Implements the neuroscience concept that memories exist in different accessibility states.
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! Modern memory science recognizes that memories don't simply "exist" or "not exist" -
//! they exist on a continuum of accessibility. A memory might be:
//!
//! - **Active**: Currently in working memory, immediately accessible
//! - **Dormant**: Easily retrievable with partial cues (like remembering a friend's name)
//! - **Silent**: Exists but requires strong/specific cues (like childhood memories)
//! - **Unavailable**: Temporarily blocked due to interference or suppression
//!
//! ## Key Phenomena Modeled
//!
//! 1. **State Decay**: Active memories naturally decay to Dormant, then Silent over time
//! 2. **Reactivation**: Strong cue matches can reactivate Silent memories
//! 3. **Retrieval-Induced Forgetting (RIF)**: Retrieving one memory can suppress related competitors
//! 4. **Interference**: Similar memories compete, with winners strengthening and losers weakening
//!
