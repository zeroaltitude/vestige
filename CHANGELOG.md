## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-26

### Changed
- **Tool Consolidation**: 29 tools → 8 cognitive primitives
  - `recall`, `semantic_search`, `hybrid_search` → `search`
  - `get_knowledge`, `delete_knowledge`, `get_memory_state` → `memory`
  - `remember_pattern`, `remember_decision`, `get_codebase_context` → `codebase`
  - 5 intention tools → `intention`
- Stats and maintenance moved from MCP to CLI (`vestige stats`, `vestige health`, etc.)

### Added
- CLI admin commands: `vestige stats`, `vestige health`, `vestige consolidate`, `vestige restore`
- Feedback tools: `promote_memory`, `demote_memory`
- 30+ FAQ entries with verified neuroscience claims
- Storage modes documentation: Global, per-project, multi-Claude household
- CLAUDE.md templates for proactive memory use
- Version pinning via git tags

### Deprecated
- Old tool names (still work with warnings, removed in v2.0)

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- FSRS-6 spaced repetition algorithm with 21 parameters

- HNSW vector search with USearch (20x faster than FAISS)
- Hybrid search combining BM25 keyword + semantic + RRF fusion
- Two-stage retrieval with reranking (+15-20% precision)
- MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
- Tauri desktop application
